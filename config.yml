basics:
  # log directly to console
  logToStdout: true
  # only relevant if logToStdout is false
  logFile: ./logfile.log

  # Main Hotfolder that is used
  inputFolder: ./in/
  # the correct filename that is lookd for
  filterdFiles: ".*\\.pdf$"
  # the target folder where to sort files to
  outputfolder: ./out

  cleanInputFolder:
    # should wrong filenames be sorted out (to another Directory)
    sortOut: true
    # where should wrong files be placed?
    sortOutFolder: /tmp/notused
    # should there be exceptions to the sorting out pattern?
    sortOutException: "config\\.yml$"
